# Advanced Linear Algebra

Welcome to the Advanced Linear Algebra project! This project explores core concepts in matrix theory and linear transformations using Python and NumPy. The goal is to deepen your understanding of important mathematical structures and provide the skills to compute them manually and programmatically.

## üìö Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, you should be confident enough to explain the following concepts clearly and without assistance:

### Matrix Fundamentals

- **Determinants**: Understand the role of a determinant in linear algebra and how to compute it using various approaches (expansion by minors, row reduction, etc.).
  
- **Minors and Cofactors**: Learn how to isolate submatrices to compute minors and cofactors, and understand their importance in more advanced operations.

- **Adjugates**: Grasp the concept of the adjugate (or adjoint) of a matrix and how it's used in finding matrix inverses.

- **Matrix Inverses**: Define what makes a matrix invertible and calculate the inverse using the adjugate and determinant method.

- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Identify and compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors and interpret their meaning in the context of transformations.

- **Matrix Definiteness**: Determine if a matrix is positive definite, negative definite, semi-definite, or indefinite, using principal minors or eigenvalues.
