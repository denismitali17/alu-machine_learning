Calculus, particularly differential and integral calculus, is a fundamental mathematical tool in machine learning. It's essential for understanding how models learn, optimize their performance, and make accurate predictions. Calculus provides the framework for analyzing functions, which is crucial for understanding the mechanics of algorithms like gradient descent and backpropagation.
